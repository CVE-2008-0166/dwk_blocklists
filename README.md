# dwk_blocklists
Debian weak key blocklists: SHA-256(Modulus) for RSA keys, and SHA-256(XCoordinate) for EC keys

These blocklists were generated using the [dwk_blocklist_generator](https://github.com/CVE-2008-0166/dwk_blocklist_generator) application and the [generate_dwk_blocklists.sh](https://github.com/CVE-2008-0166/key_generator/blob/main/generate_dwk_blocklists.sh) helper script.
